TODO:
-   [ ] Differentiate descriptives bw WP and report
-   [ ] Cut section on internet connectivity
-   [ ] Keep only % rural and Capital NUTS in regional model
-   [ ] "convergence" analysis
-   [ ] ANOVA by block: country \| region/urb (including connectivity) \| occup \| sector

Maybe:
-   [ ] variance of actual TW for same occupations across countries/regions;
-   [ ] TW by age band
-   [ ] potential relocation at regional level (Schiccitano et al.)

Done:
-   [x] Unpack descriptives of highest and lowest TW areas: by nuts, degurba, urbur (x Country):
-   [x] summarise increase in telework at the territorial level (develop summary stat)
-   [x] check stats include hw:NA: yes
-   [x] "Czechia"
-   [x] explain differences wrt ESTAT sample:
    -   age: 15 year or over
    -   Activity and employment status: "Employed persons except contributing family workers" [NCFAM]
-   [x] TW stats at EU level by degurba: Tables/Telework_degurba.xlsx
-   [x] region work vs residence for border workers (before-after COVID) <https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_publication/field_ef_document/ef19036en.pdf>, p. 78
-   [x] Figure 6: add intermediate vs urban axis
-   [x] scatter homework index x telework \~ degurba
-   [x] scatter homework index x telework (unit = region) \~ degurba
-   [x] Clean plot with top/bottom regions
-   [x] Ask Patrizia about connectivity data
-   [x] compute teleworkability (and gap to actual telework) by NUTS-2 (urburb) based on LFS; change of over time
