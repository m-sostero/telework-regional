TODO:

-   [x] Unpack descriptives of highest and lowest TW areas: by nuts, degurba, urbur (x Country):

-   [x] summarise increase in telework at the territorial level (develop summary stat)

-   [x] check stats include hw:NA: yes

-   [x] "Czechia"

-   [x] explain differences wrt ESTAT sample:

    -   age: 15 year or over
    -   Activity and employment status: "Employed persons except contributing family workers" [NCFAM]

-   [x] TW stats at EU level by degurba: Tables/Telework_degurba.xlsx

-   [ ] ANOVA by block: country \| region/urb (including connectivity) \| occup \| sector

-   [ ] variance of actual TW for same occupations across countries/regions; "convergence" analysis

-   [ ] compute teleworkability (and gap to actual telework) by NUTS-2 (urburb) based on LFS; change of over time

-   [ ] region work vs residence for border workers (before-after COVID) <https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_publication/field_ef_document/ef19036en.pdf>, p. 78

-   [ ] potential relocation at regional level (Schiccitano et al.)

-   [x] Figure 6: add intermediate vs urban axis

-   [x] scatter homework index x telework \~ degurba

-   [x] scatter homework index x telework (unit = region) \~ degurba

-   [ ] TW by age band

-   [x] Clean plot with top/bottom regions

-   [x] Ask Patrizia about connectivity data
