TODO:

- Unpack descriptives of highest and lowest TW areas: by nuts, degurba, urbur (x Country):
 - scatter homework index x telework ~ degurba
 - summarise increase in telework at the territorial level (develop summary stat)
- ANOVA by block: country | region/urb (including connectivity) | occup | sector 
- variance of actual TW for same occupations across countries/regions; "convergence" analysis
- compute teleworkability (and gap to actual telework) by NUTS-2 (urburb) based on LFS; change of over time

- region work vs residence for border workers (before-after COVID)

- potential relocation at regional level (Schiccitano et al.)
